# Deploying Sentiment Analysis Model

This is a repo for a project in Deep Learning udacity Nanodegree.

In this project I construct a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. I create this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, I deploy your model and construct a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model.
